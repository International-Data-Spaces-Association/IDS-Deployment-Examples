# IDS Testbed

The [IDS Testbed](https://github.com/International-Data-Spaces-Association/IDS-testbed) provides a setup to test your own Connector implementation with a local IDS deployment.

The setup contains two [Dataspace Connectors](https://github.com/International-Data-Spaces-Association/DataspaceConnector), a Certificate Authority (CA), an [Omjedn DAPS](https://github.com/Fraunhofer-AISEC/omejdn-server) and a [Metadata broker](https://github.com/International-Data-Spaces-Association/metadata-broker-open-core).

You also can use the setup to get familiar with the IDS in general.
