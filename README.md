The IDS Deployment Examples Repository is used to provide working deployments across the various IDSA repositories. This has several advantages:
* The examples provide appropriately pre-built Docker, Kubernetes, Helm configurations that others can use.
* It ensures that specific versions have been tested together and work together.
* In addition to the actual components from the [IDS Reference Architecture Model](https://www.internationaldataspaces.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/IDS-Reference-Architecture-Model-3.0.pdf), combinations of components can also be provided as a setup.

## Overview

The repository is organized as follows: 
* Per component or component bundle (union from e.g. Dataspace Connector and Metadata broker or Dataspace Connector and Trusted Connector) a folder is created. This again contains possibly independent Variatonen for e.g. minimal/full Setups or Helm/Kubernetes/Docker Setups.
* Additionally there is a templates folder, which provides templates for the Deployment Examples.
