</h1>
This is an implementation of an International Data Spaces (IDS) Metadata Broker, which is a registry for IDS Connector self-description documents. It is currently under development and intends to act as a reference for members of the International Data Spaces Association (IDSA) to help with the implementation of custom Broker solutions. Work on this repository closely aligns with the IDS Handshake Document, which describes the concepts of communication on the IDS in textual form.

This document aims to aid IT administrators or developers in the installation of the IDS Metadata Broker.
