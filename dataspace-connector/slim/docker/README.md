      Dataspace Connector - Slim Setup
  <br>
</h1>

This is a deployment example for the **Slim Setup** of the Dataspace Connector.
In this setup only the [Dataspace Connector](https://github.com/International-Data-Spaces-Association/DataspaceConnector) and Postgres as database are started, without Camel, ConfigurationManager and UI.

This allows us to only using the core functionalities of the Dataspace Connector without having an graphical user interface and the logic of the ConfigurationManager to install IDS Apps and configure Camel routes.

**Note**: 
This example can not be used with the current IDS Metadata Broker off-the-shelf, because a valid IDS identity certificate is not included. 
To get and install your own IDS identity certificate please read the instruction: [IDS Certificate](https://international-data-spaces-association.github.io/DataspaceConnector/Deployment/Configuration#step-2-ids-certificate).
Other than described there, the ```config.json``` and the ```KeyStore``` are located at  ```/dataspaceconnector/config/```
